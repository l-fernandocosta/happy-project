## About the Project

Happy is a basic dashboard system created to improve some of the skills I'm learning. All built with responsive web design.

I used the mirageJS library, which lets frontend developers mock out backend APIs.

This library was used to create HTTP routes for creating, editing and removing users, and some functionality provided by the library, such as 'factories'.
